Flake weather service! Hello fellow developers! This is my semester project where I made a weather API using ASP.NET Core in latest .NET 7 (not using minimalAPIs). The API provides several endpoints that can be invoked to get environmental data such as temperature,humidity,pressure etc. Mind it that these data are collected using dedicated hardware (NodeMCU ESP-32S borad, DHT22 sensor,BME 280 sensor ,Neo-6M GPS sensor). Mutiple units of these devices are installed at specific locations to gather weather data. Currently it doesn't predict weather conditions but that should be added soon in near future. Stay tuned ✨
