<<<Flake>>> weather service!
Hello developers! This is my semester project where i made a weather API in latest .NET 7
The API provides several endpoints that can be invoked to get environmental data such as temperature,humidity,pressure etc.
Mind it that these data are collected using dedicated hardware (NodeMCU ESP-32S, DHT22,BME 280,Neo-6M GPS) 
Mutiple units of these devices are installed at specific locations to gather weather data
Currently it doesn't predict weather conditions but that should be added soon in near future
